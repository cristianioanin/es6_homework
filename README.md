Informal School of IT - Assignment on ES6 features

Having a set of students and teachers data, fetch the required resources using jQuery's AJAX.
Results should be displayed as cards, grid-list type.

**Implementation**
ES6 features used in this project:
  - modules
  - Class syntax
  - getters (for private fields or computed properties)
  - destructuring assignment
  - Subclass extends Class
  
Implement routing using KendoRouter to simulate SPA behaviour.
Use jQuery for DOM targeting and manipulation.

I used [RandomUser](https://randomuser.me/photos) API for adding profile images and contact details to the initial set of data.
